Thanks to its parallel kinematic structure and miniature ball joints, it achieves good mechanical stiffness and a large range of motion.
The motors are off the shelf stepper motors dr‚Äãiven by a 30 kHz closed loop controller and a very precise PWM signal.
A 'magnetic gearing' approach increases the resolution of the low-cost magnetic rotary encoders by a factor of 30 allowing for steps down to 50nm
(**Please mind the difference between resolution and accuracy**. The absolute accuracy is significantly worse.

The device can be controlled via simple G-Code commands over a USB serial interface and is thus easily integrated into other projects.
The firmware implements a complete motion planning stack with look-ahead for smooth and accurate path following capabilities.

## üêç Python-API

The lightweight Python API handles all serial communication and provides convenient command execution and debug message printing.
The interface includes functions to home, move, and calibrate the device, as well as to query device information.
Simply copy the [open_micro_stage_api.py](software/PythonAPI/open_micro_stage_api.py) file into your project (also install the dependencies in requirements.txt), and you‚Äôre ready to get started.

## Usage Example
```python
from open_micro_stage_api import OpenMicroStageInterface

# create interface and connect
oms = OpenMicroStageInterface(show_communication=True, show_log_messages=True)
oms.connect('/dev/ttyACM0')

# run this once to calibrate joints
# for i in range(3): oms.calibrate_joint(i, save_result=True)

# home device
oms.home()

# move to several x,y,z positions [mm]
oms.move_to(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, f=10)
oms.move_to(3.1, 4.1, 5.9, f=26)
oms.move_to(0.0001, 0.0, 0.0, f=10)

# wait for moves to finish
oms.wait_for_stop()
```

## API Functions (most relevant functions only)
```python
connect(port, baud_rate=921600)
disconnect()
set_workspace_transform(transform)
get_workspace_transform()
home(axis_list=None)
calibrate_joint(joint_index, save_result)
move_to(x, y, z, f, move_immediately, blocking, timeout)
set_pose(x, y, z)

```

## ‚ú® Firmware v1.0.1

This update improves calibration, homing, logging, and adds several new G-Code commands.

### Improvements
- **Homing**: parallel homing support, higher repeatability, more accurate geometric reference  
- **Joint calibration**: refined procedure, persistent flash storage (no recalibration after reboot)  
- **Logging**: clearer and more detailed output  

### New G-Code Commands
- `G28` ‚Äî Home joints (supports homing multiple axis simultanously for faster startup)
- `G24` ‚Äî Set pose command (directly sets servo targets, bypassing motion controller)  
- `M17/M18` ‚Äî Enable/Disable motors (with pose recovery from encoders on enable)  
- `M51` ‚Äî Read encoder values  
- `M55` ‚Äî Set servo loop parameters 
- `M56` ‚Äî Joint calibration (with save-to-flash option)  
- `M57` ‚Äî Read various information about the device state  
- `M58` ‚Äî Read firmware version

## ‚öô CAD-Files

All CAD models are made in **FreeCAD** to‚Äã allow everyone to view and modify the design without subscribing or paying for a proprietary CAD solution.
Note that most components are already designed with the goal to make them easily machinable on a 3-Axis CNC-Mill.
You can also 3D-Print the parts but have to live with thermal drift (carbon filled filaments can reduce this problem).

</div>

<br>

The CAD files can be found here: [CAD Models](construction).
Please note that FreeCAD version **1.1.0dev** was used, and the files might not work with older versions.

STL files for printing can be found here: [STL Files](construction/STL_3D_Printing/)

## ‚öô Kinematic Model

The kinematic model is defined here: [kinematic_model_delta3d.cpp](firmware/MotionControllerRP/src/kinemtaic_models/kinematic_model_delta3d.cpp).
Please check the dimensions of your build against the values set in the constructor. In particular, make sure the arm length matches.

## ‚öô Electronics

IMPORTANT: If you fabricated PCB version v1.2 (see version label on the board) you need to drill out a misplaced via on diode D1 that shorts 5V rail to ground (See [repair image](electronics/pcb_v1.2_fix.jpg) ). The problem was fixed in v1.3.

The electronics are designed in **KiCAD** and only commonly available modules (motor drivers and MCU boards) are used and connected by a simple PCB. No SMD soldering is required to populate the board to make the build extra accessible.
For usual winding resistance of your motors, the device should be powered by $${\color{lightgreen} 5V-6V }$$ (2A) to keep current and heating to a reasonable level.

## ‚öô Firmware

The firmware is written in C++ and takes some inspiration from the 'SimpleFOC' project. It aims to be streamlined and readable without any extra fuss, focusing on the hardware used in this project.
It implements path planning with look-ahead and, unlike many other motion controller projects, supports true 6DOF-Pose interpolation and planning, making it ready for driving hexapod motion platforms; that may or may not be the next step for this project.

You may find configuration for pin numbers, motor type, and other parameters in [hw_config.h](firmware/MotionControllerRP/src/hw_config.h). Please check them before uploading the firmware.

### Building and Flashing the Firmware

For building and flashing the firmware, Visual Studio Code (available for free on Windows and Linux) is recommended.
Install the PlatformIO add-on and open the firmware folder. You can now build and flash the firmware like any other PlatformIO project.

## ‚öô G-Code Interface

The firmware supports only a small subset of G-Code commands listed below.  
Each command is acknowledged with either an **`ok`** or **`error`** response.  

If a command provides additional information (e.g., the *get position* command), that information is returned **before** the `ok` message.  
The client must wait for an acknowledgment from the previous command before sending the next one‚Äîotherwise, behavior is undefined.
| Command           | Description                                                                 |

| `M17`          | Enable motors and read current pose as the start pose.                     |
| `M18`          | Disable motors.                                                            |
| `M50`          | Get current internal pose. (Encoders are not read here)                                   |
| `M51`          | Get current encoder angles (in degrees) and raw encoder values.              |
| `M52`          | Get the number of items in the planner queue.                               |
| `M53`          | Check if all planned moves are finished (`1` = finished, `0` = not finished). |
| `M55 A B C D F` | Set servo loop parameters. <br>‚Ä¢ `A`, `B`: position PI controller gains (P and I) <br>‚Ä¢ `C`, `D`: velocity PI controller gains (P and I) <br>‚Ä¢ `F`: velocity filter time constant |
| `M56 J S`      | Calibrate a joint. <br>‚Ä¢ `J`: joint index <br>‚Ä¢ `S`: save calibration result |
| `M57`          | Get device and servo loop info: homing/calibration state, angles, loop frequencies, and file list. |
| `M58`          | Get firmware version.                                                      |
| `M204 L A`     | Set linear and angular acceleration. <br>‚Ä¢ `L`: linear acceleration <br>‚Ä¢ `A`: angular acceleration |

*Note: The communication protocol uses 3D vectors for rotations. The direction represents the rotation axis and the length of the vector represents the angle of rotation around the axis.
